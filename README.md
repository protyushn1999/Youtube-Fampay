# Backend Assignment | FamPay

## Project Goal
To make an API to fetch latest videos sorted in reverse chronological order of their publishing date-time from YouTube for a given tag/search query in a paginated response.

## Basic Requirements
- Server should call the YouTube API continuously in background (async) with some interval (say 10 seconds) for fetching the latest videos for a predefined search query and should store the data of videos (specifically these fields - Video title, description, publishing datetime, thumbnails URLs and any other fields you require) in a database with proper indexes.
- A GET API which returns the stored video data in a paginated response sorted in descending order of published datetime.
- A basic search API to search the stored videos using their title and description.
- Dockerize the project.
- It should be scalable and optimised.

## Bonus Points:
- Add support for supplying multiple API keys so that if quota is exhausted on one, it automatically uses the next available key.
- Make a dashboard to view the stored videos with filters and sorting options (optional)
- Optimise search api, so that it's able to search videos containing partial match for the search query in either video title or description.
    - Ex 1: A video with title *`How to make tea?`* should match for the search query `tea how`

##   Reference:

- YouTube data v3 API: [https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started)
- Search API reference: [https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list)
    - To fetch the latest videos you need to specify these: type=video, order=date, publishedAfter=<SOME_DATE_TIME>
    - Without publishedAfter, it will give you cached results which will be too old

## How to run the project

- Clone the project to your desktop
- Go to client and server directory and run  **npm install** to install all the dependencies for frontend and backend.
- Update the mongodb URL with your local mongodb URL
- Run the backend and frontend by running **npm start** in separate terminals

## How to test the APIs

- The frontend will launch at PORT 3000 and backend at port 9000
- Wait few secs for cronjob to populate the data in mongoDB server

    ### Testing the backend APIS
    
    - For searching a particular keyword based in title and description , we have to create an index on both.This can be achieved by following command in mongodb shell (db.videos.createIndex( { "title": "text", "description": "text" } ))
    -  For searching any particular video based on title or description - Make a GET request to (http://localhost:9000/search?q={query}). This is give all the videos matching the keyword.
    -  For getting all the videos saved in the database in a paginated response sorted in descending order ofpublished datetime - Make a GET request to (http://localhost:9000/paginated-videos?page={pageNum}&limit={Limit}) to get the particular page videos and corresponding data.
    -  For getting the video based on videoid - Make a GET request to (http://localhost:9000/video/:videoid). This will return the json data for the video and its corresponding youtube URL.
    
    ### Testing the frontend
    
    - The server would launch (http://localhost:3000/) which is the search page. It internally calls the search API based on title and description.
    - User can view all the saved videos by clicking on (View all videos) button on the search page which redirects the user to (http://localhost:3000/paginated-videos). User can now choose the page number and limit per page to view the video for the particular page sorted according to descending order of published datetime. NOTEL: The product of given page and limit should not exceed the total video in the database.
    - By default clicking the load button will load the videos currently present in the database.
